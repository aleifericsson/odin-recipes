        <li>Indonesian kecap (~ 3tbsp)</li>
        <li>egg</li>

    <h3>Methodology</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>steam the rice until its edible</li>
        <li>cut up the garlic, green onions and onion</li>
        <li>sautee all of them with butter but maybe put the onions in first to fry the up longer</li>
        <li>take it all out and cook the egg however you want on the pan (but if its not sunny side up its a crime)</li>
        <li>in a bowl mix the rice with some kecap (season to taste) along with salt and pepper and all the veggies</li>
        <li>pat the rice into the bowl shape and plate it with the egg and kerupuk (add cucumber slices and onions if you want the illusion that it's healthy)</li>
